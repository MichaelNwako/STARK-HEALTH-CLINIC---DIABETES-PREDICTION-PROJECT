# STARK-HEALTH-CLINIC---DIABETES-PREDICTION-PROJECT
A study using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, etc.) for diabetes detection using patients data.
# Data Collection --- Patients Data
# Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning e.g. handling missing, duplicates, outlier values, etc., Features scaling, Data splitting,Correcting minority class (non-diabetic patients) imbalance-SMOTE
# Data Training: Splitting the dataset into train and test data for machine learning with various classifiers and hypertuning
# Model Evaluation --- Checking for metrics e.g. accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score
# Testing Data -- using test data set
# Results Prediction
