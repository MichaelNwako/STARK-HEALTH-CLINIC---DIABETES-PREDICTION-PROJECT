# STARK-HEALTH-CLINIC---DIABETES-PREDICTION-PROJECT
A study using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, etc.) for diabetes detection using patients data.
1. Data Collection --- Patients Data
2. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning e.g. handling missing, duplicates, outlier values, etc., Features scaling, Data splitting,Correcting minority class (non-diabetic patients) imbalance-SMOTE
3. Data Training: Splitting the dataset into train and test data for machine learning with various classifiers and hypertuning
4. Model Evaluation --- Checking for metrics e.g. accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score
5. Testing Data -- using test data set
6. Results Prediction
